layout: "about"
mission: "At Strength Edge Tech, we're committed to delivering cutting-edge computer vision and multi-sensor systems applied in professional strength and conditioning coaching environments."

story_part1: "Our journey began with a struggle by Gatis (founder) to track performance changes in Olympic weightlifting training during COVID-19 lockdowns. This was the starting motivation to apply background in software development and computer vision research to develop tools for tracking long-term performance changes in strength and conditioning. 


Together with co-founder Joseph and his insights as an experienced S&C coach, we started Strength Edge Tech with the aim to reduce unnecessary manual data capture of athletes and replace that with intuitive computer vision tools providing objective and tailored metrics to assist the professional coaching process using the best technological solution available."

story_part2: "We are working towards SET-vision systems becoming a new paradigm in S&C, and we envision systems such as ours becoming the standard in all professional sports with dedicated S&C coaching practices."
